# Rebel Headquarters - A Sandbox For Decentralizing the World

> This is a Sandbox for playing with the technologies of the future. As such,
> please do not hesitate to steal any of my code. I plan on building this out
> more and sharing anything fun through the open source community as I do so.
> I have spent the last 12 years of my career working on the backbend. For many
> years now I have been flirting with front end coding and fulfilling my 
> full-stack destiny. This project is about fulfilling that destiny. 

> Please come back as I will continuously be updating.
