# Journey To the Front End

My journey to the full stack has been quite a humbling one. I started out my career as an embedded software developer and had fun working as close to the hardware as possible. It was a great learning experience but after I started seeing everything in HEX I realized it was time to move on.

The next job got me a little closer to the front end. Now, I would be destined to writing and maintaining server side applications. I went being a pusher of 1's and 0's to being a pusher of more complex data structures. Security, performance, scalability would become woven into my psyche. Yet, I've still only flirted with the front end. In this venture the closest I would come to the front end was in internationalization of a product catalog. I was now writing API's that were directly consumed and rendered on the front end. I was one step closer to the front end.

I created an secure, performant and scalable endpoint which produced data that would be rendered on a web page. I made it. But once that data left that endpoint, I knew little to nothing about how the data was actually displayed. I recall hearing things like Angular and Knockout but that was the extent of my knowledge.

My next job would take me even closer to the front end. I would learn things like node and javascript but my main focus was still on the backend services. I would add many useful skills to my repertoire but no sign of ```<html><html/>``` yet.

That would change in the next gig. Time to spread my wings and finish learning the the second half of that bloody stack.

I never much cared for the front end. I had very little exposure to anything to do with the front end but I knew one thing, that I was above HTML and CSS. That's what the front end guys are for.
